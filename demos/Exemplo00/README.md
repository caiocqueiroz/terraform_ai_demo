Explain the differences between the types of infrastructure provisioning models on Azure.

### ARM Templates
- JSON
- Declarative
- Complex
- Difficult to maintain
- Difficult to read

### Terraform
- HCL
- Declarative
- Simple
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to read

### Bicep
- DSL
- Declarative
- Simple
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to read

### Terraform vs Bicep
Terraform and Bicep are two infrastructure as code (IaC) languages that allow developers to define and provision cloud infrastructure using code.

- Terraform:
It is a multi-cloud tool, which means it can be used to manage infrastructure on any cloud provider, including AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, among others.
It is declarative, which means you specify the desired state of the infrastructure and Terraform takes care of achieving it.
It uses the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure as code.
It has a large community and ecosystem, with many modules and providers available.
It is widely used in the industry and has good documentation and support.

- Bicep:
It is a domain-specific language (DSL) that is designed to simplify the creation of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.
It is declarative, like Terraform, which means you specify the desired state of the infrastructure and Bicep takes care of achieving it.
It is designed specifically for Azure, so it is tightly integrated with Azure services and resources.
It is simpler and easier to read than ARM templates, as it uses a more concise syntax.
It is still relatively new compared to Terraform, so it has a smaller community and ecosystem, but it is gaining popularity among Azure users.

In summary, Terraform is a more general-purpose tool that can be used to manage infrastructure on any cloud provider, while Bicep is a specialized tool that is optimized for managing Azure resources. Both tools are declarative and aim to simplify the process of defining and provisioning cloud infrastructure using code.
