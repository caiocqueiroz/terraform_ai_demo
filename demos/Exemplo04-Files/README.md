In this example, the differences between the Terraform files should be explained

- main.tf file contains the definition of the resources to be created, such as the resource group, app service plan, and web app. 

- variables.tf file contains the definition of the variables to be used in the main.tf file, such as the location and name of the resources. Explain the validation and conditionals.

- outputs.tf file contains the definition of the outputs that will be displayed after the resources are created, such as the URL of the web app. 

- provider.tf file contains the definition of the provider to be used, in this case, Azure. 

- terraform.tfvars file contains the values of the variables to be used in the main.tf file, such as the subscription ID and tenant ID. 

- terraform.tfstate file contains the current state of the infrastructure, such as the resource group, app service plan, and web app. 

- .terraform folder contains the Terraform configuration files, such as the plugins and modules used in the script.

To run this example, run the following commands:

```bash
# terraform init
terraform init

# terraform validate
terraform validate

# terraform plan
terraform plan -out main.tfplan

# terraform apply
terraform apply "main.tfplan"
```

You can access the web app clicking on the URL displayed in the output.
